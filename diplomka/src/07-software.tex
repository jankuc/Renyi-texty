\chapter{Accompanying Software}

All the software used for obtaining results presented in this work is available for downloading or sharing via version control software \texttt{Git} at  \href{https://github.com/lamatko}{\texttt{http://github.com/lamatko}}. 

Relevant projects are \texttt{JAmde} which is a java-maven project for MC simulations of minimum distance estimators. It is able to compute tables presented in this work, compute many other divergence estimates e.g. Rényi, Kolmogorov, generalized Cramér and Kolmogorov-Cramér divergences. Source code and some insight to the project was also shared with Lucie Hanáková, who by simulation study to her work \cite{Hanakova} added some p.d.f. estimators such as stochastically equivalent histograms, kernel estimators and so on.

\texttt{FNAL-Gof} is a MATLAB project which comprises of many different statistical tools to analyse primarily FNAL data, but apart from database tools which are tailored specifically to FNAL data it can be used for all feasible statistical applications. It comprises of weighted c.d.f. and p.d.f. estimators, weighted versions of many statistical tests and so on. Aforementioned database tools are already used by colleagues working on Fermilab analyses with the use of MATLAB.

\texttt{DDT} is also a MATLAB project containing methods for using Divergence Decision Trees. Methods are written very generally leaving room for modifications like using different divergence criteria, it is designed for easy swapping of used divergences and classification methods. It is also used by some colleagues working on similar projects.
