Apla -  Aplanarity is defined as the smallest eigenvalue of the normalized laboratory-frame momentum tensor of  the jets and the W boson.
Spher -  Sphericity is essentially a measure of the sum of the transverse momentum in the event with respect to the event axis
HTL -  scalar sum of lead 4 jets + muon
JetMt - is deÔ¨Åned as the transverse mass of the vector sum of all four leading jets in the event
HT3 - is scalar sum of the transverse momentum of the three leading jets
MEvent - The invariant mass of the lepton, the neutrino and leading jets. The energy of the neutrino is determined constraining the invariant mass of lepton and neutrino to the mass of the W boson;
MT1NL - 
M01mall - invariant mass of leading and next-to leading jet divided by invariant mass of full event
M0nl - invariant mass of leading jet, lepton and neutrino
MT0nl - transverse mass of leading jet, lepton and neutrino
M1nl - invariant mass of next-to-leading jet, lepton and neutrino
Met - missing transverse energy (imbalance in pT of event) due to neutrino(s)
Mtt - invariant mass of top and anti-top quark pair candidate
Mva_max - maximum mva output of jet, the higher the more likely to be that jet originates from b-quark. signal usually peaks at 1, bg like Wlp at 0.
Wmt - transverse mass of W boson candidate, multijet/qcd bg peaks lower than signal
Wpt - transverse momentum of W boson candidate
Centr - centrality, ratio of scaler sum of transverse momentum of all jets to energy of all jets
DRminejet - distance dR between electron cand and jet, used to suppress electron fakes
DiJetDrmin - distance dR between jets
Ht - scalar sum of transverse momentum of all jets
Ht20 - same as above but only for jets with |eta| < 2
Ktminp - minimal dR between 2 jets multiplied by minimal transverse momentum, than divided by scalar sum of lepton transverse momentum and missing transverse momentum
Lepdphimet - dphi between lepton and missing energy
Lepemv - output of electron discriminant, the closer to 1 the more likely to be an electron.
