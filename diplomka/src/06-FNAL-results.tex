\chapter{Application to Fermilab data}
jak dopadly testy, srovnavani promennych, jak dopadly separace

\noindent In this chapter we will present some results of methods described in chapters \ref{ch:GoF} and \ref{ch:DDT}. 

\section{Variable ranking and testing}
In this section we present results  of the use of methods presented in chapter \ref{ch:GoF}. As was said earlier, we will rank available variables according on their similarity between DATA and MC and their difference between signal and background. In both cases, we use all the methods presented in chapter \ref{ch:GoF}.

\subsection{Signal vs. background}
