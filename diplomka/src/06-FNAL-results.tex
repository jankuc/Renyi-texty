\noindent In this chapter we will present some results of methods described in chapters \ref{ch:GoF} and \ref{ch:DDT}. 

\section{Variable ranking and testing}
In this section we present results  of the use of methods presented in chapter \ref{ch:GoF}. As mentioned above, we rank available variables according on their similarity between DATA and MC and their difference between signal and background. In both cases we use all the methods presented in chapter \ref{ch:GoF}. We have studied six different physical configurations described in section \ref{sec:topQuark}, namely muon with $2, 3, 4+$ jets and electron with $2, 3, 4+$ jets.
	
Figures \ref{fig:e2j-KSR}, \ref{fig:e2j-med} and \ref{fig:e2j-SBG} show statistics relevant to data sample corresponding to collisions resulting in electron with $2$ jets. As can be seen in all the figures, variable HT3 (fifth from left) is missing. We did not shift the other variables in order to maintain a constant format of the figures.

As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:e2j-KSR-KS}, KS,  

We are able to observe strong correlation between the results of KS, CM and AD statistics meaning, that their results are for a
